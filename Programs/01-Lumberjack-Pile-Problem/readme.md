# LumberJack Pile Problem

## Description

The lumberjacks are cutting wood in the forest. In the forest, they want to pile their logs in a grid n x n. 

### Input:

You will be given the size of the storage area. The number of logs we have to put into storage and the log count in each pile currently in storage. You can either read it in from the user or hardcode this data.

**Input Example:**

```
3
7
1 1 1
2 1 3
1 4 1
```

So the size is 3 * 3. We have 7 logs to place and we see the 3 * 3 grid of current size of the log piles.

### Log Placement:

We want to fill the smallest piles first and we want to evenly spread out the logs. So in the above example we have 7 logs. The lowest log count is 1. So starting with the first pile in the upper left and going left-right on each row we place 1 log in each 1 pile until all the current 1 piles get a log. (or until we run out). After that if we have more logs we then have to add logs to piles with 2 (again moving left-right on each row.)

Keep in mind lumberjacks do not want to move logs already in a pile. To even out the storage they will do it over time by adding new logs to piles. But they are also doing this in an even distribution.

Once we have placed the logs we need to output the new log count for the lumberjacks to tack up on their cork board.

### Output: 

Show the new n x n log piles after placing the logs evenly in the storage area.
Using the example input I would generate the following:

```
322
223
242
```

Notice we had 6 piles of 1. Each pile got a log. We still have 1 left. So then we had to place the logs in piles of size 2. So the first pil gets the last log and becomes a 3 and we run out of logs and we are done.
